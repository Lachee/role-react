# role-react
A simple discord bot for your private servers that will give you roles on reaction.

## Setup

Quick guide how to setup the bot

### Dependencies

* Node 14 or newer
* NPM
* [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### Run Steps

1. `cp .env-sample .env`
2. `nano .env` (or `vim`, you do you. Setup the bot token here. Or notepad++.... just edit this text file)
3. `npm i`
4. `node index.mjs`

### Configure
After you invited the bot to the server, run `$create` in discord.
This will take you through a wizard.

**NOTE**

Make sure you have the bot's role higher than all the roles you wish to award.
